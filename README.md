The Projects Goal was to create a simple game on my own within reason.

The player will need sound for this game, Headphones are highly recommended because some sounds may be hard to hear without them.
The play will need to listen to both sides of the room and take the path that leads away from the bad sounds.
I found out that If statements were my best friends for this game. I used Classes to hold the game and score board.

The Process went fairly well, I have a list of the goal path that I followed in my game documentation

I learned that things aren't always as hard as I may think. I was afraid of doing this game
because I didn't know how I would do the buttons or how the game would make a side "bad". I just had to
mess around and experiment with pygame and simpleGE and It was way easier than I expected

I got stuck trying to add a timer to once you click the bad path, The reason I wanted this timer
was to allow a sound to play before the game stopped, unfortunately I was causing issues so I removed
the Feature

I would like to improve the visuals, I like what I did for the Background but I wish I would have
turned it into a gif so that It was moving around slightly.

I strayed slightly from the document and added more steps as I got more ideas, Orginally
it was just one sound

I stayed on track by just working on the project, I just sat down and worked on it when I was feeling motivated.
